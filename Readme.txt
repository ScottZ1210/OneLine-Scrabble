I made a Oneline Scrabble game for this project. It meets every requirement that was asked for.
The tiles are randomized, I have a button for shuffling the tiles on the rack (which it does correctly).
I have a button for submitting the word which presents how many points it was for that word. Before the game is reset,
it calculates the total amount of points made from all the words that were submitted. You are not able to put a tile on the board
in a spot that doesn't have a letter. You are able to take the letter off the board and put it in the rack, disregardling the fact 
that you can also leave it anywhere on the board. But when you move it close it automatically puts it on the rack.

The part that doesn't work is the blank tile. For some reason it was struggling to read the file for the blank tile and it wasn't being read to the screen.
